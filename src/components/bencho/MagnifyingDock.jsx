       on a touch screen twice over. A mouse event is the smaller
       half of it — the real problem is that a touch is captured
       to whatever it started on, so sliding a finger along the
       dock keeps sending every event to the first icon you
       landed on and nothing else ever learns the finger arrived.
  
       One handler on the bar, and the index comes from where the
       pointer is: the nearest item centre to the pointer's x.
       Measured rather than derived from the index, because the
       items are not all the same width once one of them is
       magnified — the geometry moves as you sweep, which is
       exactly what makes a dock a dock, and an arithmetic guess

       Two different things with confusingly similar names.

       The phase is capture because each item stops
       pointerdown propagating — it has to, or the wall card
       behind it treats a press on the dock as a press on the
       card. Bubbling handlers here never ran: measured, the
       magnification sat on item 0 through a full sweep.
       Capture runs top-down, before the child can stop it.

       What this does NOT do is call setPointerCapture. The
       touch is already captured to the item it began on
       whether we ask or not, and those events reach here
       with their real coordinates, which is all this needs.
       Capturing on the bar as well would retarget the click

               and lifts over another is a drag, and a browser is
               entitled to send no click at all. Measured — the flag
               stayed armed and ate the next real mouse click, so
               the dock ignored the first thing you pressed after
               any touch sweep. Cleared at the start of the next
               gesture instead, which is true whatever the browser
